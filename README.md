About Me

As a Software Engineer and current student in Computer Science, I am passionate about using technology to grow as a scientist and make a positive impact on the world. With real-world experience on the front end, back end, and testing, I have developed many skills that enable me to be a driving force in whatever position I am put into as an engineer. These skills have allowed me to become a full-time testing engineer at CHG Healthcare, reviewing and testing code daily, as well as being a representative for my team in terms of our testing procedures. Along with my working experience in JavaScript and SQL, I am also proficient in Python, Java, C, and other coding concepts like Machine Learning and Graphics. As an engineer who is dedicated to leadership and communication, I am committed to delivering high-quality work that is driven through teamwork and thorough quality assurance.

kNN - Machine Learning
	
The kNN machine learning algorithm was one of the last projects for this class, applying nearly everything we have learned in the class in order to apply this algorithm to a data set. 
In essence, this algorithm predicts the placement of new data points by using weights and distances. 
This assignment not only challenged my critical thinking, but also brought to attention my global responsibility as a developer. 
Through this assignment, I learned how to mitigate bias in a data set, and apply those strategies to my algorithms in regards to a data set.

Pong Step 3 - Artificial Intelligence
	
Creating a game of Pong with and creating a difficult opponent with artificial intelligence was one of the more notable projects of my time at Westminster University. 
Through this project, I was able to put my critical thinking and creativity skills into practice.
I was able to be creative by creating my own strategy for the AI in order to create the best version possible.
Along with this, we had to consider all aspects of the game, and use whatever parameters we could in order to make it as accurate as possible.
