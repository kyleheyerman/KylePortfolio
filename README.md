kNN - Machine Learning
	
	The kNN machine learning algorithm was one of the last projects for this class, applying nearly everything we have learned in the class in order to apply this algorithm to a data set. In essence, this algorithm predicts the placement of new data points by using weights and distances. This assignment not only challenged my critical thinking, but also brought to attention my global responsibility as a developer. Through this assignment, I learned how to mitigate bias in a data set, and apply those strategies to my algorithms in regards to a data set.

Pong Step 3 - Artificial Intelligence
	
	Creating a game of Pong with and creating a difficult opponent with artificial intelligence was one of the more notable projects of my time at Westminster University. Through this project, I was able to put my critical thinking and creativity skills into practice. I was able to be creative by creating my own strategy for the AI in order to create the best version possible. Along with this, we had to consider all aspects of the game, and use whatever parameters we could in order to make it as accurate as possible.
